Implementing the N-body program in Rust (with a little bit of EC(S) thrown in).

This is almost a direct translation from an assignment in a Parallel Systems
course I took algorithm-wise.
The interesting part of that assignment is that we had to use UPCâ€”the
interesting parts of this implementation are:
* it's in Rust,
* it's a little optimized, and
* it has the data layout of an EC(S) implementation.

Documentation: clone and run `cargo doc`

Benchmark: clone and run `cargo bench`.

| Processor/System | Output |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| 2.9 GHz Intel Core i9/MacOS | [72.774 ms 73.207 ms 73.692 ms] |
| 2.9 GHz Intel Core i9/MacOS (`rust` Docker) | [75.678 ms 76.128 ms 76.629 ms] |
| AMD Ryzen 5 2400g/Fedora Linux | [95.662 ms 96.389 ms 97.223 ms] |

The master branch has slightly better performance (2%) than the `update` branch.

## Using Docker
### Building the image
```
docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t rust-nbody:latest .
```

### Entering the shell
Useful for compilation, benchmarking, etc., rather than doing everything from Dockerfile `CMD`.

```
docker run -it --rm --user "$(id -u)":"$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/opt/src rust-nbody:latest /bin/bash
```

## TODO
maybe check out leapfrog finite difference approximation scheme
-> ran into this question while trying to specify data flow
